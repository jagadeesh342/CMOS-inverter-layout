# Project Description :
This project involves designing and simulating an inverter layout using the Magic VLSI tool. 
    The goal is to understand the layout design process, including creating a layout for an inverter circuit, 
    ensuring design rule compliance, and simulating the design to verify its functionality.


## Features :

   - **Inverter Layout Design:** Creating the layout of a basic CMOS inverter.
    <br>
   - **Design Rule Checking (DRC):** Ensuring that the layout adheres to the specified design rules.
    <br>
   
   - **Simulation:** Simulating the inverter design using a suitable simulator to verify its functionality.
    <br>


## Tools Used :
- Magic: For layout design
- IRSIM: For circuit simulation
